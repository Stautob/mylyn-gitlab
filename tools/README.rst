This repository provides a set of non-IDE tools to support developers help in
the plug-in development workflow. If you need one of those tools, please feel
free to add this repository as a submodule to your project.

.. attention::
   Either check in with this repository of subcribe to the "builds" channel on
   Slack to stay up to date with the current tools.

If you want to contribute to the development process of the tools themselves,
please feel free to add your own scripts and helpers. Make sure that your
contribution is useful for more than one project and check that it does not make
any non-standard assumptions about the project structure.

Build Helper Script ``build``

The ``build`` helper script provides a simpler interface to the Maven based
build infrastructure of Eclipse plug-ins. For a quick overview of the supported
options and commands check ``build --help``.
